## Overview
This dotfiles collection has files used for the following:
- SSH Authorization and Authentication (.ssh folder):
  - This folder contains configuration files related to SSH, including public and private keys for authentication, known hosts, and other settings. These files are crucial for securely connecting to remote servers via SSH.
- Bash aliasing (bash_aliases and .bashrc):
    - The `bash_aliases` file contains custom alias definitions, which are shortcuts for frequently used commands or command sequences. These aliases make the command line more efficient and productive. The .bashrc file is a shell script executed by Bash whenever a new terminal session is started. It often includes settings, environment variables, and additional configuration for the Bash shell.
- Git configuration (.gitconfig and .gitmessage.txt)
  - The .gitconfig file stores configuration settings for the Git version control system. This includes user information, default behavior, and custom aliases for Git commands.
The .gitmessage.txt file can be used as a template for commit messages. It helps maintain consistency and clarity in commit history by providing guidelines or prompts for writing informative commit messages.
- Vim configuration
- Install script to install multiple packages, symbolic links, vim plugins, and automation in bash shell
